# toastystats
Scripts for scraping Archive of Our Own (AO3), Tumblr, Fanfiction.net (FFN), and Wattpad to gather fandom data.

These are all python scripts that will output CSV files containing
data about fanworks (plus some helper functions).  Anyone is welcome
to use them, for any purpose.  I encourage sharing of major improvements/additions with the community.

For details on how to use AO3 scripts, see [AO3/AO3_README](AO3/AO3_README).
These scripts include:
* CASE 1: FINDING THE BIGGEST FANDOMS ON AO3
* CASE 2: GETTING SUMMARY STATS FOR AO3 TAGS
* CASE 3: TRACKING AO3 TAG ACTIVITY OVER TIME
* CASE 4: TRACKING OVERALL AO3 ACTIVITY OVER TIME
* CASE 5: FIND TOP SHIPS AND FANDOMS FOR A TAG

For details on how to sample random fanworks from AO3, FFN, or
Wattpad, see [Sampler/README](Sampler/README).

For details on how to use Tumblr scripts, see [Tumblr/TAGSTATS_README](Tumblr/TAGSTATS_README).
