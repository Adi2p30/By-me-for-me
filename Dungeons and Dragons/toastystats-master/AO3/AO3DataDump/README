These files are all subsets of the AO3 Selective Data Dump for Fan
Statisticians, described here:
https://www.archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/18804

Each of these files contains just the canonical tags with a particular
tag type (e.g., Rating, Relationship).  I additionally added a
Polyships file that contains just the canonical relationship tags that
contain at least two innstances of "/".

I created these using createSmallerAO3TagsFiles.py.
