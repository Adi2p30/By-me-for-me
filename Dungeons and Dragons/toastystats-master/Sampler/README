# sampleFanworks.py
# Last modified: June 1, 2021

sampleFanworks.py lets you sample random fanworks from AO3, FFN, or
Wattpad.  It does so by grabbing random numbers between 0 and the
maximum fanwork ID # on the given archive, then constructing a
URL to try to retrieve a fanwork with that ID number.  

In order to run this, you'll need to estimate the maximum fanwork ID #
for the site.  You can do that by browsing recent fanworks on the site
and looking at their ID numbers (the number is part of the URL).

Example usage:

> python sampleFanworks.py "Wattpad" 100 1910000 "wattpad.csv"

This would sample 100 random URLs from Wattpad, with IDs less than
1910000, and output their metadata into wattpad.csv.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

- some of the AO3 metadata is not being reliably collected and will be
  missing from some fanworks.  And I think popularity metrics (hits,
  kudos, etc) are not always correct.

- Each URL may or may not correspond to a fanwork (some numbers never
  corresponded to a fanwork, some fanworks have been deleted, and on
  AO3 some fanworks are not public and thus can't be retrieved).  This
  means you may need to sample a much larger number of URLs in order
  to get the number of fanworks you want (especially on Wattpad).
